# Decentralized DNS Protocol

A blockchain-based protocol for decentralized domain name registration and resolution. This project aims to replace the centralized DNS root infrastructure with a transparent, permissionless, and censorship-resistant alternative, while remaining interoperable with the traditional ICANN-based system.

## 🌐 Key Features

- ⚙️ **Blockchain-anchored NS Records**  
  Stores only authoritative name servers (NS) on-chain for efficiency and scalability.

- 🔁 **Hybrid DNS Resolver**  
  Resolves domains registered in the blockchain and falls back to ICANN DNS for traditional TLDs.

- 🪙 **Token-Based Incentives**  
  Domain registration, updates, and transfers require native token fees, which are distributed to stakers.

- 🔐 **Permissionless Ownership**  
  Domain registration and updates are cryptographically secured via private key signatures.

- 📡 **Censorship Resistance**  
  Fully decentralized, no single entity can block or seize domain names.

## 📦 Components

- **Blockchain Node** – Handles registration, staking, and validation.
- **DNS Client** – Hybrid resolver with support for both decentralized and ICANN lookups.
- **Smart Contracts / Ledger Format** – (Planned) for domain ownership and registry enforcement.
- **Governance Tools** – (Planned) for protocol updates and TLD management via on-chain voting.

## 🛠️ Status
